- Behavior is the result of motivation, ability, and prompts taken at the same time. This is a simple formula that can lead to incredible results. In other words, a behavior is the result of:

- Motivation- desire to execute the behavior.

- Ability- capacity to execute the behavior.

- Prompt - cue to execute the behavior.

#### 4 Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
- Whenever you feel good, your brain notes and reinforces the actions you performed to get there. This means that experiencing pleasure helps you to encode new behaviors. When you experience pleasure (or, more specifically, an outcome that yields a “reward prediction error,” in that the outcome was better than you expected), your brain releases a shot of dopamine. This dopamine helps to lock in the habit.
